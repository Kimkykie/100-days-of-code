### Day 4: Jan 6, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Today I read You Don't Know JS : Scopes and Closures. Learnt a lot about Lexical Scoping, IIFEs and Function and Block Scopes.

### Day 5: Jan 7, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Did some practice on Javascript  Events using vanilla Javascript and I did this flag events exercise to see if I got a good grip on events. 

**Thoughts** I'm hopeful that with time I will be able to do most things(events) with Vanilla Javascript.

**Today's Progress**: Did a Student Form Validation Exercise I saw suggested on Quora. I implemented the logic well but the design was kind of basic.
